Predicting the health condition of potato plant based on its image


# Plant Leaf Condition Classifier

## Overview
This machine learning project aims to classify the condition of potato plant leaves based on images. The classification includes three categories: healthy, late blight, and early blight. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically the ["PlantVillage Disease Classification" dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village). This dataset contains images of various plant diseases, and our project focuses on potato leaf conditions.



## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and evaluation)

## Usage
To use the plant leaf condition classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Dataset**: Obtain the dataset from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arjuntejaswi/plant-village).

2. **Environment Setup**: Install the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
